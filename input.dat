# Typical syntax: 2*0 1*1 - 1*2 1*3 c=1.0
# Represents 2A + B -> C + D (c = 1.0)
# Coefficient of unity can be omitted along with *
# Unrecognised sequences are ignored
# Reactions without c provided are ignored
# Either reactants or products can be omitted completely
# This would represent influx / outflow
# Dash separates sides, so "0 c=5.0" represents outflow of 0
# "- 0 c=5.0" represents influx
